# 🛡️ FOURNILO MVP

**Fournilo** is not a feature.  
It’s a shield for bakers operating in chaos — offline, under pressure, before sunrise.

This MVP is built to respond directly to field reports from Sipho and others.  
Every screen, every widget, every line of code is a tactical answer.

## 🎯 Mission

Build a 100% offline Android app for informal bakers to:
- Track orders
- Confirm pickups
- Monitor payments
- Survive the morning rush

---

## ⚔️ Dev Mentality

We don’t code like tourists.  
We code like operators.  
Every file is a weapon. Every commit is a trace.
